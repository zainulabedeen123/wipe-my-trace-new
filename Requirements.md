Subject: Legally Binding Request for Immediate Deletion of Personal Information Pursuant to CCPA Section 1798.105

Dear [Company Name or Sir/Madam],

I hereby submit a formal and legally binding request for the immediate and permanent deletion of all personal information your company has collected, processed, stored, or disclosed about [Client Name], pursuant to Section 1798.105 of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Civil Code §§ 1798.100 et seq.

**Identifying Details:**
- Full Name: [Client Name]
- Address: [Client Address]
- Email Address: [Client Email]
- Phone Number: [Client Phone]

**Legal Basis for This Request:**
Under Section 1798.105(a) of the CCPA, [Client Name], as a California resident, has the unequivocal right to direct your business to delete their personal information from your records. Your company, which operates as a commercial data broker rather than a government-mandated entity (e.g., a credit reporting agency subject to federal regulation), lacks any lawful basis to retain or process their personal information absent explicit consent.

Your potential reliance on a "legitimate business purpose" under Section 1798.105(d) is invalid. The CCPA permits denial of deletion requests only under narrowly defined exceptions (e.g., completing a transaction, complying with legal obligations, or internal uses reasonably aligned with consumer expectations). As a data broker engaged in the collection, sale, or dissemination of personal information for profit, your activities do not meet these criteria. The fundamental right to privacy, as protected by the CCPA and California law, supersedes any commercial interest you may claim.

Furthermore, pursuant to Section 1798.120(a), [Client Name] explicitly exercises their right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. Given your business’s involvement in data trading, you are obligated to honor this opt-out request and cease all sales or disclosures of their data for monetary or other valuable consideration, as defined under Section 1798.140(t).

**Scope of This Request:**
1. **Complete Deletion**: You must permanently and irreversibly delete all personal information about [Client Name]—including but not limited to their name, contact details, behavioral data, and any derived or inferred data—from all your databases, systems, backups, and any other storage mechanisms, whether physical or digital.
2. **Third-Party Compliance**: You must notify all third parties (e.g., service providers, contractors, or data recipients) to whom you have sold, shared, or disclosed their personal information, instructing them to delete it, as required by Section 1798.105(c).
3. **Disclosure Report**: You must provide a detailed, written list of all third parties—identified by name, address, and contact information—who have received, accessed, or purchased their personal information, pursuant to their right to know under Section 1798.115.
4. **Confirmation**: You must provide written confirmation of full compliance with this request within 45 days of receipt, as mandated by Section 1798.130(a)(2), including verification that all deletions (internal and third-party) have been completed.

**Non-Compliance:**
If you refuse or fail to fully comply with any aspect of this request, you are required to provide a detailed legal justification within the 45-day period, explicitly citing the specific CCPA provision(s) (e.g., Section 1798.105(d)(1)-(9)) that you believe exempts you from deletion obligations. Generic or unsubstantiated refusals will be deemed non-compliant. Be advised that partial compliance (e.g., deleting some but not all data) violates Section 1798.105 and will not satisfy this request.

**Consequences of Failure:**
Failure to comply fully and timely with this request will prompt escalation by:
- Filing a formal complaint with the California Attorney General under Section 1798.155 for investigation and enforcement.
- Pursuing private legal action for statutory damages, injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees, as permitted under Section 1798.150, should your non-compliance result in unauthorized access or disclosure of personal information.

**Response Deadline:**
I expect your written confirmation of compliance—or a legally substantiated denial—within the mandatory 45-day period, calculated from the date of your receipt of this request, per Section 1798.130(a)(2). For clarity, this deadline is [Formatted Deadline, e.g., April 20, 2025]. Please send your response to [Client Email] and [Client Address].

This request constitutes formal notice under the CCPA. I recommend retaining a copy of this correspondence for your records, as it may be used in any subsequent legal or regulatory proceedings.

Sincerely,  
Wipe My Trace on behalf of [Client Name]

Subject: Legally Binding Request for Immediate Erasure of Personal Data Pursuant to Article 17 GDPR

Dear [Company Name or Sir/Madam],

I hereby submit a formal and legally binding request for the immediate and complete erasure of all personal data your organization has collected, processed, stored, or disclosed about [Client Name], pursuant to Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).

**Identifying Details:**
- Full Name: [Client Name]
- Address: [Client Address]
- Email Address: [Client Email]
- Phone Number: [Client Phone]

**Legal Grounds for This Request:**
Under Article 17(1)(c) GDPR, [Client Name] is entitled to demand the erasure of their personal data when they object to its processing. They hereby formally exercise their right to object under Article 21(1) GDPR, asserting that your organization’s processing lacks a lawful basis and infringes upon their fundamental rights.

Your organization may claim "legitimate interest" under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a basis for processing their data. However, this requires a demonstrable balance between your interests and their rights and freedoms, as enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. As a commercial data trader—not a legally mandated entity such as a public credit registry—your profit-driven activities do not outweigh their right to privacy. We assert that no compelling legitimate interest exists, and any balancing test under GDPR Recital 47 favors this erasure request.

Additionally, your processing does not qualify as "necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest" under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, nor do you hold their explicit consent under Article 6(1)(a). Absent a valid legal basis under Article 6, your continued retention or processing of their personal data constitutes a violation of GDPR.

**Scope of This Request:**
1. **Complete Erasure**: You must immediately and irreversibly erase all personal data concerning [Client Name]—including but not limited to their name, contact details, behavioral profiles, and any derived or inferred data—from all your systems, databases, backups, archives, and any other storage media, whether digital or physical.
2. **Third-Party Compliance**: You must notify all recipients (e.g., processors, controllers, or other third parties) to whom you have disclosed their personal data, instructing them to erase it, as required by Article 19 GDPR. This includes any onward transfers.
3. **Disclosure Report**: You must provide a comprehensive, written list of all recipients—identified by name, address, and contact details—who have received their personal data, pursuant to their right to information under Article 15(1)(c) GDPR.
4. **Confirmation**: You must provide written confirmation of full compliance with this request within one month of receipt, as mandated by Article 12(3) GDPR, verifying that all deletions (internal and third-party) have been executed.

**Non-Compliance:**
If you refuse or fail to fully comply with any part of this request, you are obligated to provide a detailed legal justification within the one-month period, explicitly citing the specific GDPR provision(s) (e.g., Article 17(3)(a)-(e)) that you claim exempts you from erasure obligations. Any refusal must be substantiated with evidence demonstrating that an exception applies (e.g., a legal obligation under Union or Member State law). Vague or unsupported denials will be deemed non-compliant, as will partial erasure that leaves residual data in your systems or with third parties.

**Consequences of Failure:**
Failure to comply fully and within the stipulated timeframe will result in escalation, including:
- Lodging a formal complaint with the national Data Protection Authority under Article 77 GDPR for investigation and enforcement, potentially leading to fines under Article 83.
- Pursuing legal remedies under Article 79 GDPR, including compensation for material or non-material damages under Article 82, should your non-compliance cause harm or unlawful processing.

**Response Deadline:**
I expect your written confirmation of compliance—or a legally substantiated refusal—within the mandatory one-month period from the date of receipt, as per Article 12(3) GDPR. For clarity, this deadline is [Formatted Deadline, e.g., April 6, 2025]. Please send your response to [Client Email] and [Client Address]. Extensions under Article 12(3) will only be accepted with a reasoned justification provided within the initial month.

This request serves as formal notice under GDPR. I advise you to retain a copy of this correspondence, as it may be submitted to a Data Protection Authority or court in any subsequent proceedings.
